    "The story:  Youâ€™re a graduate student reading a paper and the authors have made the code for their analysis available on their labratory's website. You'd like to reuse and reference some of the code for your current project. The code for the analysis is linked in the footnotes, but the researcher has since left that university.  Their new lab's website no longer has a link to that code and no one is responding to your emails.  How do you access the code? You don't!  :-(\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a few ways that you could have been saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The researcher uploads their code to a repository, such as their institutional repository, Zenodo, FigShare, or even GitHub\\*  \n",
    "2.  The researcher could have linked thier GitHub repository to a Zenodo or FigShare archive, and provided the corresponding DOI within the paper.  Even if they later take down their GitHub repository, the DOI should still resolve to that archival entry within the repository.  Additionally, the repository could update the redirect from the DOI to wherever the archived files moved to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either condition, the DOI will remain stable within the manuscript and the paper would not need to be updated even if the content the DOI redirects to moves.  Should the underlying content move, the DOI resolver can be updated with that new location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* GitHub repositories can still be moved and deleted, but in some contexts still more stable than just a personal website.\n",
    "\n",
    "DOIs (digital object identifiers) are just one type of unique identifier, you may see other kinds across the publication landscape.  Additionally, there are two types of DOIs:  CrossRef and DataCite.  Each of these DOIs should resolve under the normal process, the difference is mainly just in who is issuing them out.  CrossRef DOIs are generally the kind that is created for papers and publications from journals while DataCite DOIs are created for repository resources, such as data and code.  This should not directly impact your selection of repositories.  Other common unique identifiers are [Handles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System), which you will see commonly throughout institutional repositories in academic institutions."

However they are used, DOI and other similar identifiers are meant solely to be unique and stable identifiers for resources.  This means they can be assigned to smaller portions of papers, such as figures, or even for individual proteins or crystal structures within repositories.\n",

    "The implication of having a DOI is solely of stability and not necessarily of quality.  That said, individual repositories may have specific requirements about when and how they issue DOIs for resources.  The DOI service is just a system that they utilize to create identifiers."
