    "The story:  Youâ€™re a graduate student reading a paper and the authors have made the code for their analysis available on their labratory's website. You'd like to reuse and reference some of the code for your current project. The code for the analysis is linked in the footnotes, but the researcher has since left that university.  Their new lab's website no longer has a link to that code and no one is responding to your emails.  How do you access the code? You don't!  :-(\n",

    "1.  The researcher uploads their code to a repository, such as their institutional repository, Zenodo, FigShare, or even GitHub\\*  \n",
    "2.  The researcher could have linked thier GitHub repository to a Zenodo or FigShare archive, and provided the corresponding DOI within the paper.  Even if they later take down their GitHub repository, the DOI should still resolve to that archival entry within the repository.  Additionally, the repository could update the redirect from the DOI to wherever the archived files moved to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either condition, the DOI will remain stable within the manuscript and the paper would not need to be updated even if the content the DOI redirects to moves.  Should the underlying content move, the DOI resolver can be updated with that new location.\n",
