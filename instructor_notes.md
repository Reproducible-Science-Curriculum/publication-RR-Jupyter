# Instructorâ€™s notes

## Motivation

## Timing
Exercise 1: Ranking (7 minutes)  
Whole Group Discussion of Exercise 1 (5 minutes)  
Instructor Led Discussion about record-level metadata types (7 minutes)  
Discussion about keywords (4 minutes)  
Exercise: Picking keywords for gapminder dataset.  
 - Individually pick max five keywords for the gapminder dataset. (3 minutes)  
- Work with partner, pick max five keywords (can come up with new ones or use from union). (3 minutes)  
- Whole group discussion to pick max five keywords final. (5 minutes)  

## Customization
- You can use other Zenodo entries. Make sure that you choose at least one entry with a non-descriptive title (eg "Dataset5"), one with a 
descriptive title but no keywords, and one with both a descriptive title and good keywords. 
- For the ranking exercise: worst = no keywords + vague title < no keywords + descriptive title < descriptive title + 
vague keywords < descriptive title + descriptive keywords = best.
- When running low on time, prioritize the ranking exercise and the related discussion and skip the keywords exercise.
