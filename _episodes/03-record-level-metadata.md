# Creating Record Level Metadata

## Learning objectives:

- Evaluate and rank the quality of existing metadata records.
- Describe the types of and importance of record level metadata. 

## Metadata quality: Good - Better - Best

### Exercise 1 - rank these Zenodo entries in terms metadata quality (7 minutes)

This is a continuation of the Exercise 3 in the [Documentation](documentation.md) section. Rank these from from 1 (most helpful/informative) to 3 (least helpful/informative):

* MS Salmanpour. (2016). Data set [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.193025
* Solange Duruz. (2016). Simulated breed for GENMON [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.220887
* Zichen Wang, Avi Ma'ayan. Zika-RNAseq-Pipeline v0.1. Zenodo; 2016. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.56311

Discuss the results. Specifically, answer and discuss the following questions:

* What were the criteria that you used to rank? 
* What was missing? 
* What was the most helpful? 
* What was the most critical piece of information? 

## The metadata in your life

You're used to metadata within your research. You've got metadata about specific data points, observations, samples, etc.  But there are many more parts of metadata.

The information that you were looking at in the Zenodo records is metadata.  Metadata about the dataset (record) on that page.  Let's take a look at the pieces of these pages.

Point out where these pieces are:

* Title
* Authors
* Description
* Keywords

This information is important because:

* People need to find your stuff
* People need to know what your stuff is

Good metadata are important for reproducible research, because they describe the data, and thus provide the context for interpreting the data, analysis, and results.

Let's think about the workflow of discovery, the user...

1. Searches for something
2. Reviews the results - is this the kind I was looking for, and if so, is it worth studying further?
3. Might add some filters to reduce and refine the results
4. Selects a record to review and goes to that record's page
5. Reviews the new information on this page, including the fuller description, keywords, and other readme/documentation files.
6. Downloads and digs in to the data files

This person would continue to move through these steps so long as the information continues to look sufficiently interesting.

Metadata also aid discovery. Metadata should be clearly defined and tightly integrated with the data and project ([Hart et al. 2016](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097#sec008)).
